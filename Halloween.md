# Things I want to potentially add to portfolio for halloween

## 1. A button to switch between regular and halloween portfolio

    - add two icons: one being a pumpkin and other being a sun for regular portfolio

## 2. Making the Home Page Halloween:

    - [x] Change the overall bg to a dark color like the one on Immersive Studios Haunted House Page
    - [x] Replace star with a ghost
    - [] Add a pumpkin in some where on the home page
    - [] Add a spider or two on the palm trees as well
    - [] Add a witch flying across the screen or some bats. use viewport to make it look like its flying across the screen
    - [] Change the color of text to pumpkin orange with one of the words have a bit of a flicker to it controlling the emissive intensity
    - [] See if I can make make a duplicate avatar that has some halloween features and use cooler animations like a zombie walk animation
