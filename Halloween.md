# Things I want to potentially add to portfolio for halloween

## 1. A button to switch between regular and halloween portfolio

    - add two icons: one being a pumpkin and other being a sun for regular portfolio

## 2. Making the Home Page Halloween:

    - [x] Change the overall bg to a dark color like the one on Immersive Studios Haunted House Page
    - [x] Replace star with a ghost
    - [x] Add a pumpkin in some where on the home page
    - [x] Add a spider or two on the palm trees as well
    - [x] Change the color of text to pumpkin orange with one of the words have a bit of a flicker to it controlling the emissive intensity
    - [x] See if I can make make a duplicate avatar that has some halloween features and use cooler animations like a zombie walk animation
    - [x] Add a calderon and a witch to the landing page

## 3. Adding A Unique Audio Page

    - [x] Add in react router for a simple routing system for the music page
    - [x] create music page. Create a simple audio interface with prev skip and next skip button
    - [x] add in a 3d rectangle of shape and use drei html component to display details of the song playing. It will be at the bottom in the background
    - [x] add in a cool reflective floor that makes it look like water on the floor. Use the drei example
    - [x] add in sphere that uses distort material that will utilize the audio analyser to make the sphere move to the beat of the music.
         Might also look at example of audio implementation in one of the r3f examples
    - [x] definitely want to use bloom post processing to make the sphere glow to make it spooky

# Potential Extras:

## 4. Adding a Custom Error Page

    - [] display the error code using 3d text and make it look like it is floating in the air with orange glow and flicker
    - [] look into unique way to display the main error message
    - [] add a button to go back to home page
